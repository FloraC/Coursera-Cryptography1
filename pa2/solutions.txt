1.

The events have the following probabilities:
    1. 2^-128 ~= 10^-38.5
    2. 10^-6
    3. 10^-30
    4. 10^-36
    5. 10^-42

So the probability order from most to least likely is
2,3,4,1,5

2.

At $200 each With 4 trillion = $4*10^12, the orgainization could
purchase 2*10^10 such machines.  With each machine testing 10^9 keys per second,
the orgainization could test 2*10^19 ~= 2^64.11 keys/second.

There 2^128 different AES keys. To test all possible keys, it would take
roughly 2^64 seconds, which is roughly 5.8*10^11 years.
That's more than 10^9 years.

a.
    { F(k,x) when x != 0^n
    { 0^n    otherwise

This function is _not secure_ because the adversary would submit 0^n and guess
that that the function is not random if the output is zero. 
So Adv[A,F] = |0 - 1| = 1

b.
    { F(k,x) when x != 0^n
    { k      otherwise

Not sure about this one

c.
    { F(k1, x) when x != 0^n
    { k2       otherwise

Despite the fact that a key is being sent, this function _is secure_ because
when the adversary submits nonzero messages, he learns only as much about F'
as he would learn about F, but F is secure.  When he submits 0^n, he gets a
value that is chosen uniformly from K, so it is indistinguishable from random.

d. F(k, x ^ 1^n)

This function _is secure_ it is equivalent inverting the input of F, which
cannot reveal any information to the adversary since F is secure.

e. F(k1, x) || F(k2, x)
